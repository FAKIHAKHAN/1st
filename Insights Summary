Comprehensive Business Insights & Recommendations
1. Category & Subcategory Performance

    Top Revenue Drivers:
    Kids’ apparel dominates revenue — Kids Shorts (314k) and Kids Shirts (309k) lead, followed closely by Women Tops (309k) and Men T-Shirts (303k).
    Baby accessories like Hats (306k) and Caps (304k) also rank high, indicating strong gifting potential in baby and kids segments.

    Recommendation:
    Double down on high-performing kids’ clothing & accessories through promotions, seasonal launches, and bundle deals. Women’s fashion and accessories also remain core revenue anchors — optimize stock for fast-moving SKUs.

2. Regional Performance & AOV

    Average Order Value (AOV):
    Fairly consistent across regions — Northeast leads at 274.33, Midwest at 271.87, and West slightly lower at 268.57.
    Minimal variance indicates region-based pricing or offers may not be critical.

    Recommendation:
    Focus on operational excellence (delivery speed, availability) rather than pricing changes across regions. Maintain uniform promotions unless region-specific trends emerge.

3. Payment Method & Returns

    Return Rates:
    Across payment methods, returns hover at similar levels, but subtle differences exist in average spend:

        Cash on Delivery: 272.15 kept vs. 273.47 returned

        Credit Card: 270.99 kept vs. 266.61 returned

        Gift Card: 273.09 kept vs. 272.79 returned

        PayPal: 271.56 kept vs. 258.96 returned (largest drop on returns)

    Recommendation:
    Returns don’t vary dramatically by payment method, but PayPal customers show the largest spend drop when returning items — investigate product types purchased via PayPal for possible dissatisfaction patterns.

4. Discounts, Sales, & Returns

    Discount Elasticity:

        Low discounts (~5%) generate the highest sales but also the highest returns — possible mismatch between expectations and product received.

        Moderate discounts (20–25%) strike the best balance — strong sales without a major spike in returns.

        10% discounts underperform both in sales and return rates compared to 15% or 25%.

    Recommendation:
    Shift discounting strategy toward 15–25% bands for broad promotions. Use 5% discounts only for low-return, high-trust product lines.

5. Delivery Times & Customer Experience

    Ratings remain stable across delivery days, contradicting the assumption that longer delivery = lower rating.

    Returns spike at 5 days but not consistently higher beyond that — 9-day deliveries see fewer returns than 5-day.

    Recommendation:
    Address specific bottlenecks causing issues at the 5-day mark. Otherwise, focus on reliability rather than just speed — stable delivery performance appears to maintain customer satisfaction.

6. Demographic & Device Patterns

    Age Groups:

        55+ customers place the highest average orders.

        35–44 age group has the lowest order volume.

        Age group appears in model as a predictor of returns — especially 55+ (0.0734) and 25–34 (0.0306).

    Device Behavior:

        Desktop shoppers spend the most when keeping products (277.28), followed by App (270.55) and Mobile (268.16).

        When returning, App users spend the most (275.16) — indicating loyal, high-value app shoppers.

    Recommendation:
    Tailor campaigns — push upsell bundles to desktop buyers, nurture app users with retention offers post-return, and explore conversion boosts for mobile.

7. Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)

    Top Customers:
    High RFM scores (8) come from customers with recent purchases, high spend (472–771), and at least moderate frequency — nurture these with VIP perks and early access.

    Low-value Segment:
    Lowest RFM scores (2) show customers inactive for 300+ days with low spend (< 103) — target with reactivation campaigns, e.g., personalized discounts or re-engagement ads.

    Recommendation:
    Apply differentiated marketing — loyalty benefits for high RFM, win-back campaigns for low RFM.

8. Product-level Elasticity Insights

    Positive Discount Elasticity:
    Adidas Jackets (0.087), Adidas Sweaters (0.0665), and Carter’s Sneakers (0.0524) are highly responsive to discounts — they sell more when discounted.

    Negative Discount Elasticity:
    Carter’s Hats (-0.0858) and Carter’s Caps (-0.0440) see demand drop when discounted — possibly due to perceived value loss.

    Recommendation:
    Apply higher discounting on high-elasticity products for volume, keep pricing firm for negative-elasticity items to maintain brand perception.

9. Predictive Model Insights (Feature Importance)

    Top Return Predictors:
    Discount percent (0.1998) and delivery days (0.1737) — both strongly associated with return likelihood.

    Brand Effect:
    Levi’s (0.0943) and Zara (0.0608) are more predictive of returns — review fit/quality issues for these brands.

    Category Effect:
    Men’s (0.0769) and Kids’ (0.0221) items influence return probability, possibly due to sizing issues.

    Recommendation:
    For high-return categories/brands, improve size guides, quality control, and pre-purchase information to reduce avoidable returns.
