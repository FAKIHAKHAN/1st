# 1st Repository: Retail Sales Optimization

This repository contains a project focused on optimizing retail sales through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), price elasticity modeling, and feature importance analysis using retail transaction data.

## Repository Structure

- `Amazon_Clothing_Sales_2025.csv`  
  Dataset containing 2025 sales data for Amazon clothing products.

- `Data Quality Report`  
  Summary of data cleaning, missing values, inconsistencies, and other quality checks.

- `Insights Summary`  
  Key findings, business insights, or conclusions drawn from the analysis.

- `Optimizing Retail Sales with EDA, Price Elasticity & Feature Importance Analysis.ipynb`  
  A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (visualizations, trend detection)
  - Price elasticity estimation
  - Feature importance determination
  - Recommendations for sales optimization

## Getting Started

- Core Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `statsmodels` (if used for elasticity modeling)
