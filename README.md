The file GAMES.ipynb contains two games:

Number Guessing Game – The user sets an upper limit for the range, and the computer selects a number within that range. The user then tries to guess the number, and the computer provides hints by indicating whether the chosen number is higher or lower than the user's guess.

Rock-Paper-Scissors Game – The user chooses either rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer makes a random choice. The game then determines the winner based on the classic rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
