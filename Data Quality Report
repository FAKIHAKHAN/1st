Data Types: All columns have appropriate data types after corrections; order_date converted to datetime, 
delivery_days converted from float to integer.

Inconsistent Pricing: final_price values were inconsistent with price and discount_percent; identified via isconsistent_price.

Missing Value Handling: Numerical missing values filled with column mean; categorical missing values filled with mode.

Duplicates: Found no duplicate rows.

Outliers: Histogram inspection indicated no significant outliers in numerical features. Final price column was skewed.

Feature Engineering: Added new columns: order_year, order_month, order_week, discounted, unit_price, and delivery_status (fast/slow delivery).

Customer Aggregation: Created customer-level summary for spend, order count, rating, and returns.
